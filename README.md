# CSE222: Algorithm Design & Analysis

## About CSE222

**[CSE222: *Algorithm Design & Analysis*](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CSE222)** is a 2xx-level course offered to undergrads pursuing the CSE and CS+X disciplines at IIIT-Delhi. The course focuses on the design and correctness of algorithms and to analyse their requirements. It aims to:

- enable students to use popular strategies like [Greedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm), [Divide & Conquer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm), [Dynamic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming#:~:text=Dynamic%20programming%20is%20both%20a,from%20aerospace%20engineering%20to%20economics.), etc.
- to design, analyse, and prove the correctness of algorithms and graph algorithms
- develop an understanding of [NP-Hardness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness), [NP-Completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness#:~:text=In%20computational%20complexity%20theory%2C%20a,by%20trying%20all%20possible%20solutions.), and [Reductions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_(complexity))
